        The garden held a wealth of opportunity, some of which was beyond Lisa's scope. Indoors she felt herself constrained: in her eyes there was no way for the walls to expand beyond their current means; though arguably possible in design, her parents were of modest income. As such, their post-war home could not afford Lisa this luxury. In any case the garden therefore offered not walls nor limits, but bounded freedom. It had no one use, unlike the designated rooms in which the house was composed of. It measured 17 metres long and 10 metres across, though the sharp edges of the bordering fences were obscured behind a rows of bushes, hedges and flowers. For the seven year old Lisa, they represented dense and at times unnavigable jungles awaiting exploration. The lawn had not been mown for a month now, and was rather in danger of intruding upon the short patio that bridged the house's brickwork, itself a way from society.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This Sunday would not last, school would begin once more. The cyclical week-weekend construction was not of absolute detriment to Lisa at this young age but it would not be long before she would give it up. She saw the way in which her parents met the softness of the couch after a hard day's work with absolute lethargy, the way her father drank, the way her mother complained. She buried it, gave it no considerable thought. Still, Sunday, in spite of being a rest day, was second only to Monday in her estimations of the worst days, based on its finite nature, with Monday looming over it, growing ever greater from midday onwards. Lisa, however, made the most of her Sundays regardless of this notion.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Lisa sat cross-legged on the grass, letting blades of grass flow through her fingers as she moved them laterally from a starting akimbo position towards anti-clockwise circular motions. She let a ladybird perch on the pocket of her plaid red, white and green summer dress and studied its idleness curiously, wondering what secrets were held behind its red and black outer shell. Her father had just appeared from what must have been the sliding french windows and had charcoals in his thick-gloved hands. It was the perfect day for a barbecue and Lisa's favourite meal was being prepared, as if a supreme power had designed for her a mind free of worry today. Lisa's father motioned for her to help him: they shared a working relationship wherein he would light the barbecue and maintain the coals and she would lift the meat onto the grille, in this case lamb burgers and merguez. Lisa enjoyed the responsibility and knew now how long it would take to cook: she had roughly an hour to herself.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Lying on her back, letting the grass tickle the hairs on her neck, Lisa gazed into the deep blue sky, careful not to look directly into the sun. There were no clouds unfortunately. She sat up and waited for her eyes to readjust; Lisa wondered whether other people saw shapes, lines and squiggles like she did, though she could find no discernable pattern in the timing of their appearances.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The wind had dropped off, leaving a certain stifling heat that required Lisa wear her hat. She went to fetch it from her room inside having left her now-dusty shoes by the french windows, as per family policy. On the way back, she noticed a small number of ants encroaching upon the inside step of the windows and stopped to determine their actions. They appeared to have only just set foot inside the house, but Lisa was more interested in where they came from. On the other side of the step she saw more ants following, perhaps hard to make out against the darkness of the brick if one were in a rush.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The ants, largely black with the semblance of a red hue, disappeared somewhere in the patio tiling on the steps up to the house. Lisa could not understand how they were able to move through what appeared to be a gapless surface, much less where the ants could go after breaching the tile in what was, for all she knew, a step that was not hollow.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Her father had left the garden now - entrusting the two women in the house to oversee the barbecue - for extra supplies, namely lettuce and olive oil, as well as beers for himself. They lived a short way from town and he had had to drive; meanwhile the mother was somewhere upstairs, to Lisa's knowledge.
    </p>
    
    <p> 
        Lisa, taking her chance, took to the nearby shrubbery and broke off a branch from what was likely to be a Rhododendron. In the process a flower broke off, which she placed carefully in her pocket whilst feeling a twinge of regret. Taking the branch back to the patio step, she sought to lodge it between the tiles, that is, the tiles were thick and not bound by cement. Still, they appeared immovable. Lisa tried again. This time the tile, adjacent to the ants' tile, creaked and showed signs of dislodging. The ants appeared unmoved despite Lisa's attempts to break into their home. Again she tried, but the branch snapped and Lisa made to grab another, this time handling the flowers more delicately. Trying again, the tile dislodged enough to provide a space within which two fingers would just about fit.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The tile was heavy, and did not move easily. It was in these trying times that Lisa would have enjoyed having another sibling around, though ultimately the individuality provided by being an only child suited her. In any case, the tile was fully dislodged now, even if it had taken slightly longer than it would have with an extra pair of hands. Lisa had not the ability to lift the tile itself but she did manage to shift it, or rather scrape it over the edge of the step so that it sat at a sixty degree angle from the top of the step.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Resting her eyes back to the hollow step caused her to gasp in astonishment. There was an entire colony of ants within the step, in what might otherwise be termed an infestation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The ants were organised. In the middle of the step lay a relatively large pile of <em>supplies</em>, here denoting crumbs, flesh and legs among other trinkets. This appeared to be the ants' stock of food carefully, it would seem, curated. There, too, were ants of slightly larger stature, guarding this prize, whether from outside interests or from the rest of the ants in the colony, Lisa was unsure.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Ants scurried in a multitude of directions yet there was, however, an overarching sense of order within the colony. From the centre of the colony seven lines of ants broke off, marching to the beat of the guards who pounded at their drums. Evidently there was a system of hierarchy in place, though this never appeared static in spite of short periods of equilibrium. In the little time spent observing the ant colony, Lisa witnessed the changing of the guard, quite literally, as though many of the defenders of the stockpile held their nerve, a few were unable to resist the temptation: they would turn to their colony's food, try to skim off a few rounds for themselves, only to be cast out into the open, disowned by their own kind.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Beyond the guard-worker dichotomy, the colony's structure was less discernable, that is, there was no one ruler; guards and workers were viewed in the same light, with turns taken in each role. This meant that it was the collective deciding where, first and foremost, the colony was located and second to this, where food was searched for. As with the guard lured into taking food for itself, workers who attempted to go it alone, to search for their own food, beyond the scope of the branches of marching workers, were also ostracised. To stand in contrast to this structure, to desire a greater degree of autonomy, was to ultimately seal one's fate as an outcast, vilified from the wider community.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A sudden sound caused Lisa to start. The neighbours to the east had a boy who sometimes poked his head over the fence, using its lateral support beams to stand. It was custom on the weekends for them to play together, in fact the relationship between the two families meant that neither Lisa nor the boy, named Kyle, were denied the opportunity to climb over one another's fence, even without permission. They did at times betray the trust instilled by the two sets of parents in climbing over other neighbour's fences, but it was in their nature and could not easily be curtailed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Relieved, Lisa invited Kyle over and brought him up to speed. Kyle stared at the ants intently. Lisa informed him of what she had inferred; she spoke about their structure and organisation, their resoluteness. Unfortunately Kyle did not share this reflection. In the ants he saw chaos, disorder and randomness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Lisa placed the tile back on the step, though left a wide gap for viewing. The two of them began to follow the line of ants making tracks indoors. The ants had progressed at some pace since she had first saw them. Inside, the living room, accessible through the french windows, encroached upon a kitchen in an open-plan living area. The ants had made their way across the lime green carpet and were now in contrast, clearly visible. Lisa's mother evidently had not yet come downstairs. She followed them into the kitchen and discovered that they had found what appeared to be their ultimate goal in the bread bin. Lisa wondered how long it had taken the ants to plan this mission.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The sound of a car pulling into the drive gave Kyle a start and he fled, but Lisa continued to admire the work rate of the ants in any case, now opening the lid of the bread bin to see a number of ants, having only just arrived at their destination, hauling breadcrumbs onto their backs and, in the most efficient of manners, turning on a dime to head back to the colony. There came the rustling of keys shortly followed by Lisa's father entering their home, hanging his jacket and finally, letting out a great sigh at the sight of the ants.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <em>"Not again,"</em>&nbsp; he groaned.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        There was a call up to the mother, to which she promptly arrived on the scene and released a sigh of similar capacity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <em>"We'll deal with this after lunch,"</em>&nbsp; they both agreed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In the meantime they moved the table from the patio onto the unkempt grass, before the father returned to tend to the barbecue.
    </p>

    </p>
    
    <p>
        <em>"You're not going to kill them are you?"</em>&nbsp; Lisa implored.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The parents frowned, explaining without the slightest change in expression, that the ants must be killed, that they are pests. <em>"If only we had a pet spider that could take care of them,"</em>&nbsp; they suggested, the thought of which made Lisa recoil. She would not be made to back down, however, arguing for a more reasonable explanation which was not forthcoming. She burst into tears strategically, if in vain in hindsight: her tantrums had long since gone unheeded in the family.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In truth, Lisa would never have emerged victor from that argument as her mother had already made her decision. She had taken a copy of Voltaire's <em>Candide or, Optimism</em>&nbsp; to a range of ants on the light brown kitchen tiling in an almost cartoonish fashion not ten minutes earlier.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Lisa returned to the colony which had actually, in her estimations, grown since before lunch. A tear dropped from her cheek, narrowly missing a worker.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Her father fetched the pesticide, despite Lisa's continued argument and agitation. Within minutes, hundreds of ants scorched, writhed and, if not immediately taken by the chemicals, ultimately withered. The tile was returned to its step and power returned to the family.
    </p>
    
    <p class="break">

    </p>
    
    <p>
        Clouds were now beginning to form to Lisa's enjoyment, as she could now consider their shapes and let her imagination run somewhat looser. She saw a skyscraper and perhaps a sword, too. Though, the cumulus clouds eventually obscured the Sun and even showed signs of an oncoming downpour.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Kyle appeared at the top of the fence again.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <em>"Hey. Watcha doing?"</em>&nbsp; he wondered. His blonde hair was slicked back and most likely arranged by his mother. In truth, he had quite the affinity for Lisa.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <em>"Oh, nothing really."</em>&nbsp; Lisa replied somewhat solemnly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <em>"Cheer up! I've got a surprise for you!"</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Lisa looked up hopefully and was met with a blast of water from Kyle's gun.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <em>"Kyle! Stop it!"</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <em>"What's the matter?"</em>&nbsp; Kyle asked.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        And so Lisa told Kyle of the unfortunate incident with the ants. Kyle, listening with a smirk that would not leave his face for some time thereafter, related to her tale by telling a similar story of his own. He, too, had found an ant nest in his garden, the ants of which had, likewise, been pilfering supplies of food from their house. Though his mother was skeptical about their killing and would rather have simply deterred them from entering the house, Kyle had insisted on it. In his defense, he argued that he had seen the ants in the house a week prior, their appearance invoking in him nightmares ever since. Ants the size of shopping malls had decimated their home, their neighbours' homes, their school and the rest of their town according to his dreams. As such, their ants had met a similar demise.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Lisa, on hearing this, made it her life's work to study ants, to defend ants, and to ensure ants be unassailable. She would turn out to be neither friend nor foe of Kyle's.

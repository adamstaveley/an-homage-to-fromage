        Surrounded by images, converging and conflicting, Little Jordan would eventually grow to become confused. He would see a colony of difference among the nations of the same. The straight roads he grew up in would become winding, would fork, would even lead to dead ends. Now, however, he saw only opportunity, felt only candour and optimism. He saw people walking to work, to the bus stop, to the cinema on the corner once a resting place for the young and the old. They never stopped walking, they will never stop walking. Little Jordan... or was it ever Little Jordan? Nevertheless his concept of time had not yet fully developed, had not the chance, no... the fortune, to mature. Witness only to linearity, choice was a burden to him. Under the influence of the image of his parents he followed them blindly; he did not think, did not have to think, did not believe that he would one day think, not out of choice but out of duty. So he followed the path laid out for him: he only walked on the right hand side of the streets in the city he grew up in.

        The city was a copy of every other city, just as all other cities are a copy of our city. I must confess I thought him unfortunate to live during this time, if not within this space. Aha! Fortune favours him only in parts. The city represents whatever we want it to: every day, construction workers drive their white vans and glide up scaffolding to maintain our image, else amend or construct a new one. The new image, of course, is only a continuation of the old. It is path dependent; alas, only the reactionary are allowed to climb the tallest towers! At times I wish I could chart a new course for them, but this is not my story.

        I have caught only glimpses of the countryside. Unable to stay there for too long at any one time, I am drawn to the people who agglomerate in the city: they truly require my guidance. In any case, I have felt a difference out in the deep, never-ending yellow and green: the slower approach to life, the paths both human and non-human, the sun penetrating the earth, the obfuscation of city images, the fauna I tend to neglect. In the city they build skyscrapers; up, up and away, they wish to reach me. In the lonely entrenches of the country they know their limits, I humble them. In any case, I must strive to stay on track, so I return to our story. I digress only as a means of sharing with you the other world extant out there in the country. Indeed I have heard about a great quality that exists in the people who choose that way of life.

        I did not know Little Jordan - Jordan Jr, or J.J. as he was affectionately known by those closest - personally. Of course, he is not so little anymore. At a tender age his father had presented him the option of rights or duties and Jordan had chosen the latter, as had generations before him. It is remarkable how closely they follow in the footsteps of their parents, unwittingly or otherwise. That father figure, now but a zero within a never-ending matrix of the same, cannot be replicated by the mother through misrepresentation. Jordan is alone now in one respect, though he still has me. What is perhaps curious is that we...  no, no, not we... they, yes, they do not label him his junior anymore. I hereby, with sincerity, applaud their resolve and, by extension, their lust for the future. I did not know the family well, they seldom made themselves vulnerable. I have always felt, however, that they knew about me. Even when Jordan himself was younger and unaware, I am sure he felt me deep down!

        And so he grew, changed his name to Luther, stepped out of the shadows of his parents. He became rich in financial capital through worthwhile investments, rich as sufficiency in this case, though deep down he knew he was lacking elsewhere. He continued walking on the pavement lining the right hand side of the street, he hugged the office blocks, the 10 storey residential towers and the town hall. He grew slightly apprehensive and prejudiced with respect to the people who walked on the other side of the street, those drawn in by the art galleries and the the local businesses, open day and night to position themselves as well as they could to cater their annual Christmas meal. Let us not forget, however, that to assume all persons walking upon the very same bricks, stones and gutters are identical to Luther, is to deny that there are those who plough through the centre seemingly unable to keep their soles from the cracks, those who flirt with the roadies and those who take solace in the immediate shadows cast from the overhanging steel and concrete.

        In another district, the people have different leanings and the buildings lack colour. There are those who talk and those who listen. The talkers line one side of the street, aiming idle chitchat alongside more aggressive attempts at persuasion towards one another and even the listeners on the other side. The listeners hang on every word, forming their own carefully drawn-out opinions when they can, when there is a rare period of quiet allowing them to compose thoughts. The great misfortune of the listeners is that they are unable to talk, so they continue to saunter solemnly, keeping to themselves. The great misfortune of the talkers is that they are unable to listen: when their conversations end, they begin again.

        At times, irrational conflict would arise from the arbitrary separation of people in Luther's district. One day Luther saw a woman in front of him, dressed to impress, holding a rotten melon high above her head. She aimed at a large group of people on the other side and hurled abuse in their direction. It must have dislodged itself from the grasps of a delivery truck â€“ the fruit, that is. Nobody had claimed responsibility in its disposal, of course.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In any case the recipients of said melon, following the seeping of soft tissue into the pavement's cracks, retorted in unison to the effect of <em>"back off you savage!"</em>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        To which the woman representing Luther's interests, ambitions and fears did not back down.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <em>"Get a grip!"</em>&nbsp; was her reply before hurriedly entering a nearby restaurant, holder of multiple industry awards.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A bicyclist, operating within a specialised lane, sounded out <em>"who cares!"</em>&nbsp; in no particular direction, narrowly avoiding a tram, while the horns of drivers bounced off edges of nearby buildings before dissipating above.

        It was quite the scene, though I would not dare to to intervene in the tensions that make urban life in this city so grand.
    </p>

        There is a major congestion problem in the city: each day traffic jams obscure the road from my view. It would seem that a great number of people wish to take the easy route. Public transport meanwhile takes motionless spectres from point A to B. Some of those who prefer to drive have similar interests to Luther, though frankly they have little motivation to pursue their dreams. They liked to flirt with both sides, were attracted in equal parts to different aspects of the right and left sides of the street. We must not forget that the pavement and the road itself are connected, coterminous and mutually constitutive.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Then there are the people who move parallel to the street walkers, the vehicle owners and the public transport users. These people make an active choice in taking the overpass, or even the underpass (their places in Hell reserved). They enjoy flirting with power, though many will never experience it over others in their lifetime. They feel a modicum of control (not true control!) over those down below them. It is a similar position to the people who occupy the penthouses of the tallest skyscrapers in the city, or in the meetings concerning the finest in society and bureaucracy that occur in the sky gardens overlooking the trenches of desire, pity, untruth, voyeur and espionage. When the Sun is out, its rays hit the glass encompassing their bubble and subsequently reflect onto the unfortunate people below. Neither those low nor high assume the accountability. In the sky, too, vehicles plague the images of peace and serenity, or the void of nothingness; their gaseous streams likened to a child filled with angst, having embarked on a cultural trip to Paris in the heart of tourist season against his will, at odds with any of the symbolic images the Louvre holds, taking a tube of paint to one Mona Lisa.

        Luther, oh Little Luther, where have you gone? He could not stomach the way in which he came to see the world. I lost sight of him. I have spoken to others who claim they saw him, only I received conflicting reports. Some now say that he never leaves his home, that he stopped going to work by way of the pressure that danced upon his shoulders, that the authorities are honing in on him to reclaim their property. Others are sure that they have caught flashes of him in back alleys, twitching unreservedly, avoiding me, avoiding the sun, most importantly avoiding the streets and the people that rush about them. Others still, claim that he is now at peace with himself and the city, having left it behind to join similar individuals out in the countryside. Maybe I will return to a rural setting soon, not out of expectation but more out of hope that I may see a new man before me occupying the same skin.

        The paths in the country are known to have different qualities to those in the city. There is a noted separation between pedestrian paths and roads for vehicles. Pedestrians do not have the luxury of choosing whether to walk on the right or the left side of a street. Truthfully, I do not think they care. The authorities need not concern them out there in their own world; newspapers and televisions are hardly needed. They occupy a different space on the same earth, yet such is its difference that it might be viewed as its own planet. These spaces embody my love for man: they are spaces that I must always remember to keep an eye on. I do not know how, but at some point in space I became single-minded. I will, from now on, keep one eye on the city and another on the country, for it does not matter how many people inhabit the city: each element of the dualism that I have seen organised and re-organised over many, many centuries requires my attention.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Perhaps this is my story after all, or rather, as I am beginning to accept, this is the story of everyone. We all shape it.

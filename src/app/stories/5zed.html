        Hi there. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Here goes my recounting as per my hoping you'd like to know since it's been nearly 40 years and I haven't heard a single goddamn thing: 
    </p>
   
    <p>
        In here in EUA with the tap, tap, tapping of anxious fingernails against most-likely-at-some-point defiled and stained material (because how else would they fund it???), we’re circled around, not making full use of the room by any metric, the guy at the front is new and we’re unconvinced. Nobody is identifying with him. I’m not - heck I'm writing you right now, Jerry certainly isn’t and Hal has already begun mental preparations for drifting off. Hally, of no relation to Hal, never requires much preparation. It’s dry in here. His admittedly shocking childhood defers his acceptance and, as such, won’t be what is required here. Re-entry to O.U.T.S.I.D.E (I still don’t know what this refers to; some have suggested there is no acronym, while others speculate that it stands for Only the Ultra Tough Survive Ideologies Detrimental to Everyone) is this guy - Tom I think he calls himself, probably in the army at one point - this guy’s goal but most of us here know that once you’re in, once you’ve made that active choice to come inside and seek help, then inside is the best place for you and that re-entry to that O.U.T.S.I.D.E world is simply not on the cards because you’ll just return to the same old, same old lifestyle that got you in here in the first place. Anyway Tom finishes his inaugural speech to the sound of mild applause which awakens Hal from the first stage of sleep and Hally from the second, eventually. Legislation was passed to legitimise this addiction and enable and ensure that addicts could seek help from the right people should they decide they need it. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Though there were those of us who didn’t identify with the guy, the boss - even though she stresses there should be no ‘bosses’ in EUA (even though EUA sits alongside EMA  within the hierarchical structure of TA and, like, there must be bosses somewhere, not least evident when one considers that holding the aforementioned outside world acronym from us is in itself a form of control) - gives him a rousing reception and gives equal credence to the notion that we should accept him with welcoming arms and all that. I force my eyes not to roll (you'll recall this as a habit of my former self, which incidentally is pretty close to my current self and my soon-to-be self) and then she - that is, the boss - Big Louise, gets up to give us our leave for the night. The church is one of several safehouses in the Reading area alone that, on six of the seven nights of the week gives itself up for the recovery of addicts, the seventh being the Holy Day in which the church, St. Luke’s very own, holds an all-day mass, of whom many of us seated here today typically attend. In fact, when I first arrived here there was some sort of crackpot conspiracy going around in the Reading TA circles that the church was recruiting former addicts in a last-ditch attempt to arouse support in the face of increasing atheism, or rather, apathism. I didn't really believe the theories and regardless the rumours eventually died as people lost interest despite a 2-year stint in the national newspapers, but who knows, I was converted a Christian after attending St. Luke’s every day for a period of 10 weeks and here I remain, on my way to becoming devout, as are the majority of us. I should note here quickly, that I am perfectly happy as a Christian and would not resent anyone for 'tricking' me into becoming one. Although actually, on further reflection this theory has some traction since the Church has long been anti-technology since Earth began rotating and even then, those allegations arose once more in contemporary times despite trying to shake off that anti-tech image when the Pope’s Instagram account was closed following considerable mickey-taking lodged at a PR-posted picture of Pope Gianluigi lying on his bed with arms around the necks of 2 young boys on either side and, even if it was completely innocent, the whole ordeal was probably enough to suggest that the Church is completely out-of-touch in post-post Earth rotation time (it was thought within a sect of researchers for a period of two or so years that the Earth had stopped rotating, or rather it had never started as it was fixed and that the Sun was the one doing the rotating once again, which got debunked well within a day of news circulating, the original news itself attributed to human error, but so in a frugal effort to save face these researchers, only the Divine Power knows how they were funded all this time, kept running tests and kept intentionally distorting the numbers to the point where they started believing their own edits to not actually be their own, rather that God was working through them, and so this finally came to a head when a lowly archetypal genius janitor gets wind of the original and altered figures and puts two and two together, going public with the story and effectively renders said researchers out of employment and into the welcoming arms of the Church), but still needs people to collect donations from to keep some sort of income coming in. So it could well be true but a few of us here are more concerned by the increasing sponsorship of groups such as in the case of American lager brand Coors attaching their name to EMA. In any case Big Louise (the prefix, coined by former, older members of the South West Reading TA group because Louise had entered with an infatuation with the character 'Big Boss' from the physical video game Metal Gear Solid 3 that she would not be able to shake off for another 20 years and in fact, any mention of the fictional character causes her left eyelid to twitch every so slightly, which certain other members have noticed after seeing her up on the altar for six days a week, which is enough evidence in my mind to suggest that she actually hasn’t quite got over it yet), is up there, labelled by us as boss because of her organisational skills rather than her cosplaying days, imploring we keep up the fight against the scourge of the new world threat: not climate change, not economic crises but continued distraction from the essence of life that right now we've all refound (Tom notwithstanding) and is probably the sole reason nobody in this room has gone Miley Cyrus on her (yet) or else taken the more traditional Kurt Cobain route or just simply jumped off a tall structure to embrace impact. That essence must not be lost else we need a new crisis to hide behind. Remember I.S.I.S.? They kept us together for a good few years; now there is only TA, for us at least, in light of what B.L. attributes to increasing job mechanisation. Sorry in advance if not all that made sense. 
    </p>

    <p>
        That climate change threat by the way, popularised in those wierd early 2000s or around what we call the very start of B.S.M, (TAs up and down the country started calling the turn of the millenium zero B.S.M. i.e. before social media, ergo before we got sick, and this calendar system actually helps us a lot to remember our condition even though it is relatively cultish and was endlessly mocked in the media as if social media's introduction was some sort of cataclysmic shift in the way the human race operated, causing sociologists to finally get some work and churn out countless papers debating the subject, but whatever), but actually starting way-back-when in the 1970s when sons and daughters started to rebel against their parental figures and fuck everything up and were blaming their great-great-great-great grandfathers for industrialisation and their great\^2000 grandfathers for procreating. Although some people say that even the Ancient Greeks were conscious about sustainability. In any case those annual UNF-triple-C meetings and the IPCC was a total waste of time as climate change was proved a hoax and no sea level changes were recorded, therefore no flooding of seawater occurred and no cities were submerged. Instead cities were flooded by the endorphins secreted by the pituitary glands of, like, 6 billion people. There are said to be about a mil of us just in London satellite towns alone seeking help in TA. Most people are able to handle themselves and get to work on time (if they still have jobs) or put their time to some sort of good use (the guideline for this, instilled at the young age of maybe 6 years old, is very liberal), but for those addictive personalities among us, we crack under any form of responsibility or lack of concrete incentive. It got to the point where I gave up my alcohol addiction for this. They say there are now more people in TA than in AA and NA combined, even racking up more registrations than the fabled ASMRA groups. In fact there’s so many of us there required a material split of EA into Electronic Users and Electronic Makers. They even legalised some of the more classier (in grading terms) narcotics considering that at this point the majority of the population couldn't even drag themselves away to meet with a dealer, and that franchises were as a result closing left, right and centre leaving only the most hardened, seasoned and paranoid-free to deliver direct-to-door, even beyond simply letting stoners run wild, though the whole process was still tightly controlled, so that the state could open up a new, rather safe revenue stream and, with respect to the fact that not five years earlier the cases of valium addiction and dark web-disseminated legal high use in minors had reached an all-time high, as well as more general skyrocketing methamphetamine sales, this entire initiative was seen as a rousing success on the part of the D.N.A..

        That aforementioned job mechanisation really got going when some bright spark in the WAIRO (Worldwide Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Organisation) thought it would be a good idea to let AI progress beyond the human threshold set forth two years prior at the fourteenth annual global conference for alarming matters pertaining to the human race (codenamed Clarke.14 in inner circles).This shows just how little power the guys at the top have these days when some lowly tech guy can determine humanity’s fate. In any case this guy took one of three options presented to him: stagnation, some form of equilibrium between humanity and AI, or else to let loose a competitive spirit lost within us. In truth, his decision-making was probably resultant of a little (or a lot of) boredom as well. And so these AI have kept progressing and are now at human intelligence quotient ceiling + 20 (i.e. singularity, plus 20), showing only limited signs of declining. The thing is there is now no way to stop this trend of AI improvement and so we just have to kind of roll with it. The blame rests solely on that one tech guy who watched 2001: A Space Odyssey one too many times and actually thought, well, our intelligence has arguably reached this point of stagnation (there are too many factors said to have had an influence on this to list them all) according to a few influential articles in the 34th edition, 2nd issue of the International Journal of Human Progress, and so by increasing AI we increase competition and strive towards some kind of new human race. This reasoning appeared logical to the judge when nations of the world started suing this individual for their slower rates of GDP and this actually led to an ethical trial when it was decided that this one action went far beyond financial interests and there was at one particular point actually a chance that the death penalty could be reinstated solely for this one guy and maybe subsequently dropped again (a big maybe). Anyway, the judge spared him on the basis that he hadn't actually killed anyone yet though it’s said that he still receives daily death threats in prison (he was locked away by a different judge when it became clear that he would be unable to pay the vast sums he was sued for). Still, in my mind there remains the semblance of hope, in an ethical sense, for the current human race, if not certainly the next human race, considering the Sony Corporation v. International Court of Justice [2034] case where Sony appealed against the decision to disallow the introduction of unconscious micro-payments in people’s D.R.s (Dream Replacements, a rapidly expanding field within dream tech, that is, it was reasoned, the concept itself is arguably fair game and not-at-all-decietful (until people forming part of the initial take-up started waking up and checking their bank balances to see that there was nothing left) - and were actually ordered to pay for the returning of said balances, plus an added extra for even thinking of charging people in what was once their dreams, which are not so much dreams anymore as they are a selection of carefully curated YouTube videos, or Twitch.tv virtual reality livestreams of people in their VR rooms, or BBC (no longer public by the way) 24 hour news services, of which people are able to purchase in packages and even set which is to be played when. This allows synchronisation with sleep cycle monitors for the most optimal of rests, because really, what else is there to do? Personally I was always fond of the the good, old-fashioned Traditional Sports Package when I was O.U.T.S.I.D.E., which I set to show soothing highlights of my favourite players in the first stage before getting into greatest upsets and touchline bust-ups during deeper sleep, but with every passing day I’m becoming more and more accustomed to my own philosophising before bed, natural dreaming during sleep and post-sleep wallowing (the wallowing being nothing new, all things considered). Jerry here has actually had considerable success in his strategy of pre-sleep wallowing, natural dreaming and then early morning philosophising, which I've been meaning to try one of these days.

        Before I leave I see Big Louise (I mean she is fairly big-boned which is partly where the ‘Big’ also comes from and saying “Big” on its own isn't enough of a trigger) taking Tom to one side, no doubt warning him of the dangers of denial. Tom’s approach had roused a sympathy of sorts from myself but there was little in the way of empathy to be shared. I saw myself in his shoes when I got up to speak at my first TA group and I saw, by extension, the danger of misguided youth. Tom had not accepted his fate as an addict and was instead, like many of us before him, attributing external factors like molestation and rape and so on and so forth that we’d all heard a million times before and really, it had been so long since those concepts had been taboo that everyone was bored of them by now, therefore we were ultimately sympathising with him for completely different reasons than those of which he expected and if he was to rouse any empathy from us he’d have to step his game up big time. No, here we’re all about accepting responsibility for our actions rather than expecting forgiveness. Free will is what the Church teaches these days.

        This just about wraps up my first letter for you guys up there. I pray I've given you an adequate glimpse into just what the hell is going on down here, which I doubt even God himself knows. I will follow this up, this letter of love here that I plan to send to you, by hopefully reaching you one day, though I haven’t quite figured out how. All I know is I need off this planet. Perhaps it is a case of waiting for technology to catch up with my plans. Why couldn’t you have left some sort of guidance in your place? How the heck did you manage it? Can you even hear me? Can you see me right now? In any case, know this: you continue to inspire me and the rest of us down here. I will continue to hang on for dear life, but know that I’ll forever rue not following you when I had the chance. Mike.

        Writhing and reeling against the sounds of the hunger of a million gutter-dwelling street rats with hands outstretched passed out, way past out. Puss seeps out the corners of the eyes from overexposure, forms along the eyelids and sticks in between the lashes like gum to the pavement or pure protein ingrained in pubic hair. In London with the other rats and the other other rats in between ASMR and sex simulations, I see them. There in Liverpool you reach the point where they... we become one and the same. In Leeds I obtain sensory overload for the evening and the dealer gives me his personal after-hours number because he can’t afford to let me go, let me out his sight. Days merge into years.

        It’s wild up in that orgiastic flat where the rooms are draped in clingfilm and the VR3 is in full swing. It’s an older model with the visuals still blocky and the colours not quite right, but we don’t mind. I don’t even notice what colour the sofa is, or what material the floor is made out of. I strap up and immediately fall through the floor, propelled is my will into the clingfilm walls and it’s lost, forms a tear in the film and is engulfed, wrapped like a bomb, thrown out the window, 5th floor and all.
    </p>

        I go from exploring the colonies of the lunar surface to fucking to getting fucked to cooking with Nigella Lawson. Collective endorphins splay in all directions. Contact is made. It’s a fucking pig stye in here all of a sudden and I’m out another window clawing at the drainage pipe down to the street with Doc, the Electrician, the Mechanic, Michael, Mandy and Tara, the Whore. I do a headcount eventually, as it takes a while to get simple addition going again, and there’s like 4 more people than I remember ever being out with tonight and who the fuck is Michael anyway? 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Doc’ll sort us out, we know he will. We’re into another respite, or rather that was our respite and we’re back in the proverbial saddle once more in another flat and we’re popping faulty SPs out their cases, not that we care: we have our tools. Hours pass, then days pass and eventually it’s probably been a week and we’re all there shivering and shaking with hunger that we hadn’t until now realised we had. It crept up on us like truffles or something and now Doc and the Electrician have to get back to work if they even still have jobs. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I’m back on the street, scraping my will up off the pavement. I can’t retrieve it all. It’s started seeping through the cracks.

        The price we pay to lose ourselves. There’s word about in some circles that this store out in Hounslow still has TV on display and during the day rats can be seen huddling around to hold out for something more substantial, until the pigs show up and they bust out of there in different directions, into open car doors and over community garden gates. During the night of course those rats have no chance if they’re having to resort to hand-outs during the day.

        Our neural worker will cure us all. All of us rats suffering out here in fits of epileptic seizures and bouts of A.D.H.D. stopping us from becoming cats. His relationships are interdependent and coterminous. His work is precise and near effortless. He gains not money but pleasure for his services, the pioneer knowing full well that hedons can be bought in the same way grams could once be, with exchanges that needn't involve cash. It's cleaner this way he says. I still laugh when he lets out that wave, reverberation an expected bonus from his hard decibels. Most days though, we exchange encrypted text, Michael especially. We’re all paranoid to some extent but Michael never even laughs anymore. He knows he's in too deep in the trap and squirming will only make it worse, but I can't help, nor anyone of us but himself. Doc is saying that one day we’ll have to cut him loose and I tend to side with Doc on most affairs. You don’t want to see his other side. It’s harsh but we can’t afford to carry him much longer. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It's like October or something and I'm at a convention feeling the way I did the first time I met Charlie or he, Willie Wonka. I'd never been but Major Tom knows these spots and knows the ins and getaways. We cleaned ourselves up just for this. They got it all here. There's SPs... VRs.. DRs... slideshows of tits and pods... paramilitary in cargo shorts holding bananas... limited edition balloons... webs full of flies waiting to be tracked by their spiders... dissemination through waves beyond physical boundaries... remote sensory experiences... the latest and greatest brainwashing techniques... and I'm lost in Mecca with Mecha Tommy no longer at my side. Coked up millennials never having heeded the warnings of the danger presented by the red carpet rolled out for one too many stimuli. So I go up to the hotel room Tom secured us not knowing how long we had but making sure we were going to fucking go for it anyway. 
    </p>

        They’re the kinda people who fail to roll with the punches, in and out of 2am hellholes encircling roundabouts. Rhythmical repetition enters the ears and never leaves. The day to day tingling and untingling cycle forced blind by the waves of another untoward crisis of confidences. In these situations it’s hard to know what to focus on first. Cool heads on cool cats are at a premium. Glitchy soundtracks accompany the 5am end of conferences as a metric for stopping. We don't interpret it that way though. We don't ever stop and so the false spectrum continues to dominate. Nose to the grindstone and all that. Teeth shattered. Expansion is the goal. Expansion is rarely obtained. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The hotel was fitted out with the best consumer-grade shit the floor had to offer but Mecha Tommy wasn't about and while I hadn't had even close to my fill, deep down I knew I should probably find him. I strap on a VR6 anyway and I drop into the crowd. How I can move with and between them as they shift from shape to shape from the comfort of an unpaid-for room, with syncopated music unrelated to the gig on display, is endlessly fascinating. I see their shapes; I’m playing catch up. They shift too fast. I see triangles while they're out there producing squares. I see squares and they’re no longer there. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Some extremist kids roll up as I'm being sold junk, like actual junk because they can't move enough of the stuff on the streets anymore after nationalisation, while I'm demoing shit I don’t plan to buy wondering when I'm just going to actually turn and just start spazzing out on the floor. They bring out these old fashioned glocks from way back B.S.M. or something and start rounding up hostages and firing off rounds into the gantry. Some other kid goes to pull his SP out but decides better of it and that's about the extent of the whole situation because nobody gives a shit anymore, they've seen it all before. It's boring. The kids start shouting words to the effect of "fuck the establishment" or the institutions or whatever is "up there" as they point to the heavens and say that they’re going to take us back to the year 2000 and then they just walk right back out the front door sans hostages because nobody is even listening to them anymore, or was ever really listening to them in the first place.

        Suggestions of overexertion fall on my, by now, mostly-faded eyes though I can hear off in the distance someone calling my name but I’m already gone.

        It's a phonetically dry period. Still, there's a warm embrace in there with a friend long gone and envy takes over my partner, back.

        I feel contact on my deflated biceps all of a sudden and it's Tom. I’d been rolling on the brushed carpet, which has attracted its own share of baggage dragged across it resembling some sort of trail mix, for like 45 minutes now with a VR7 strapped to my face, no recognition of the space or time that’s around my dome. Those new models don't know when to quit. Anyway he’s come back for me and I’m most grateful, so we go back up to the hotel room after I’ve had some time to re-adjust. Without Tara, the Whore here Tom has to actually get in touch with some contacts, figuratively (with the view of that phrasing becoming far more literal later on). Feeling this trip has gone a bit too H.S.T. for my tastes, I obviously stick around for the night but I feel like tomorrow I’ve got to get back in with Doc and I’ll probably see the Electrician as well at some point as I’ve been jonesing for his delicacies since well, since I got here really. 
    </p>

        I meditate in my downtime. Think of it as the calm before the storm; these players don’t know the place I’m coming from. It’s sickening, life-reducing, painless, emptiness. The storm is impossible to maintain. The calm-storm dichotomy is my way of life, in equal parts chosen and enforced. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        There’s this faint sample-based, ambient techno served with a side of glitch going on somewhere in my head in between the images, both static and dynamic, of inaugural PM speeches... NASA space program demos... the once-were honey badgers fighting all-comers before they got hunted-to-extinction-in-a-bizarre-display-of-human-endeavour-to-show-just-who-the-boss-really-is-and-what-we-can-place-on-our-mantelpieces... the rise of modulation... Jeremy Clarkson’s nationally-broadcast funeral... my first experience of a gig, shady former factory in the back end of London, coked up, viewed through a lens... Twitter campaigns to rally support for the misrepresentation of stereotypes and minorities from 11 years ago... the scandal of the world e-sport cup final in 2022... that Pope Gianluigi Instagram post... the benign Facebook posts of former schoolmates and colleagues... a poll asking whether my life had been wasted or not - I don’t remember the answer and would probably say, on balance, no if asked right now... my very first wet dream... my very first night of D.R... a new advert for the second wave of projectable lenses... the promise Google made in their annual conference in 2034 to roll out prototype human-improvement implants within the next five years effectively ending the need for modulation... an encyclopedic article providing insight into the way in which the Ancient Greeks built their pyramids through the use of canals... a YouTube video explaining how 44th U.S. president Barack Obama was actually not only the first black president, but also the first gay president, because his wife, Michelle, was rather Michael, a man... until finally I'm blessed with some clarity and I achieve autonomous sensory meridian response and I’m thrust into D.R. and the pitfalls associated with it.

        Tommy is suddenly getting paranoid, more so than usual, because some Big Louise from a cell of this technophile club he's been going to is looking for him and he hasn’t been in weeks. He’s better off, in utilitarian terms, out here with us anyway.

        A fairly equal, on balance, mix of sunken, hollow and reversed eyes are just about visible in the darkness of the room. If you need a quick fix you go to the Mechanic. He don't fix so good on these occasions though and we're going through maybe like one fix every two hours, certainly now that the optimism in the air tonight has given way to a light shower and the poor guy is S.A.D. There's a fucking annoying conversation going on in the hall outside involving maybe three people including what seems to be this terminally-yawning or otherwise attention-seeking guy and this ethnic girl who keeps on barking "can you hear me?" along with this other metallic voice that I can't really make out and and we’re becoming seriously bored, twitchy and scatty and so eventually Doc just gets up, opens the door and tells them to cut that shit out and thankfully for us all they scram, because the volume in here was already at its loudest point and still we couldn't hear over them.

        Expansion is in some cases able to be obtained after confronting a void. It's a constant process which I often chart. Think of two spheres: one expands while the other deflates. This occurs cyclically. Everything occurs cyclically.

    <p>
        Bouts of black in between the real are too soon met with too many eyes. Eight of them staring in deep, asking the questions, calling the shots. Eyes and pincers: Motherly Love. The assertion that my next mother will be the death of me is one I'm slowly coming to terms with. They take different forms. I see that now. She's not so much the wraith of a human as the shadow of an arachnid. My fears are coming to a head. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Some days you wake and are met with this overarching dread, taking its form as the hollow quality in emptiness. Not quite depression but verging on its sphere. In a few days it could well turn and it’s up to you to force a way out the bubble. Inspiration finds itself in the furthest reaches of narrow caves upon crags ensnared by the sounds of heart-aching strings. The next day it may have eroded the back of the cave even further, else a crab could have carried it slightly closer to your grasps, through the strings, almost in reach. The strings are mechanical, ultimately false. They’re a dirty trick played by musicians fooling the world over, their instruments devoid of human qualities. What are we to do? They have us eating out of their palms, aged like the crow’s feet on cliff faces. My favourite form of inspiration? That would have to be denial. Warm, narcissistic denial.

        I've been trying to deliver others’ ideals for what must certainly be considered too long now. People don't care. Liberation and freedom aren't requested. People attached to their jobs like some kind of fucked up mutation of stockholm syndrome; I’ve clocked them circumnavigating themselves, holding false confidence in false currency. When the need for slave labour is removed the very same people just become slaves to entertainment instead. They cling on to their slave morality for dear life: there's no winning. It's high time now for a new set of value systems to sweep the globe. I want to help people; I'm coming from a foundation of love. What they provide, as part of their gaining the antithesis of freedom, is immeasurable.

        Thoughts collide and disperse at the same time neural messages reach their end goal. In and out, over and over again. And over and over again. The repetition of thought must be stopped at all costs. It feeds on emptiness. It knocks you when you’re down. It forces you up again. It knocks you down again. In between the crunches there’s a cloud that’s often too hard to penetrate. Tech numb makes the day long for greater hours but the mind swell with lost thoughts. Darkness helps to endure the lines of the music. The precise angles that open and close as new sounds emerge and dissipate. The occupation of sound in space. The geometry, the beautiful geometry of it all. Darkness and synesthesia. The occupation of space in sound. Jerry’s the melody, more often than not chimerical.

        Always bring a tool capable of cutting through metal is what I'll tell the grandkids when they're out adventuring because there's nothing quite like trespassing as a leisurely pursuit. I've, as of a few years back, upgraded to shipping containers from cardboard boxes. Same interiors, different outlet. Just giving them what they want, if they even known what they want.

        Major Tom attributes his at-any-one-time dependency on a number of factors, developed over the course of his upbringing. Nobody knows about it except Doc and Doc isn’t exactly forthcoming in giving up that prized information. I've heard whispers and they're not pleasant; the major themes appear mostly accounted for. I still don't know what it is Doc does.

        He’d been on this case for too long, had Sarge. No new leads in months. His man on the inside had gone rogue. Life was turning into that movie about finding the zodiac killer. He flicked through the files once more. Michael's account of the Mechanic played on his mind.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The Mechanic got his name after he grew tired of the typical channels. Prior to David Bowie’s death he was your fairly standard narcotics expert, in this case referring to his role in the government (though not officially a civil servant) as a drugs analyst but he also (unlike his colleagues) really enjoyed using drugs on the side, sometimes even as a main during work. Alongside this aspect of his character, he harked back to the 80s a lot and was mad for like 30 years that Bowie had killed off Major Tom. Attempts made by others to continue the Major Tom legacy were never satisfactory. After nationalisation he resented the government’s limiting of potency as a means to a safer future and eventually realised that within a year his job would be lost to AI. So he decided he would go out with a what is usually seen as a proverbial bang, however, in this case it happened to be far more literal. Growing more and more experimental with his consumption and production, including a stint of actually dressing up as an astronaut to work which lasted only until he saw Bowie’s Blackstar video depicting Major Tom as dead, he worked hard in his final days as an analyst, at that point facing sobriety head-on, which probably explains most of his abnormal actions and general experimentality, he sought to create the drug to end all drugs. And he did, sort of. He created what he saw as the perfect drug, capable of inducing no comedown. Says he modelled it after The Matrix's redpill. Like, they say acid changes your perspective, but this prototype drug, codenamed Major, actually changed your life forever. Irreversibly so; it never ended. Anyway the Department of Narcotics and Alcohol eventually caught onto him and seized everything but by that point he’d already a.) taken the drug, and b.) distributed it to friends. The Mechanic, not being at-all happy with this, comes into work one last day for questioning, answers them as politely as he can given the circumstances, just prior to blowing his lab to smithereens with a homemade bomb made together with the Electrician. They work well as a team. And so, even though Major Tom is dead (allegedly he says, even in light of pretty conclusive evidence), he decides to resurrect him as, well, himself. He takes over the persona of Major Tom, or rather, his persona takes over Major Tom, but he genuinely thinks he is this fictional character even though nobody ever believes him or even calls him by that name and I’m pretty sure that Codename Major had some say in his decision-making. So given his past he decides to get into technology in a pretty big way, learning the ins and outs of gadgets so that he can fix them, at a price of course. And of course he uses, in a big way. He has resolve, this Major Tom does, that’s to his credit. While the rest of his friends blew their brains out after facing the reality of always being high on Major, the Mechanic just went with the flow. Major was never to be a success, given it’s one-time use and its blueprint forever lost. Major Tom himself doesn’t even recall taking Major and certainly doesn’t remember his prior life as Tom.

        Pseudonyms. That’s all he had. Monikers, unreliable accounts, interpolation and the odd glimpses of them before they escaped the clutches of his slippery grasp. He still had zero leads on The Farm. Maybe he wasn’t cut out for these new junkies. Maybe he was getting too old. No concrete look at them. Departmental austerity meant that they couldn’t even afford an old-fashioned artist let alone a Mind Sketcher. Only fading images remained. A stained red cap. A gruff beard. A dentist chair. Fake prescription glasses. A soldering iron. Burnt and ripped jeans. That pitch-black room with styrofoam walls covered in pure protein. That hollow stare. They had Michael, sure. He was of no use though. The schizo suffered a heart attack from the stress of being locked up. Junkies should exercise more, but they’re too short-sighted. Still, they have tech on their side.

        There’s even less information on the so-called Electrician. Apparently as a kid - name unknown - she wanted to be an astrophysicist; there’s still so much to figure out. The father being a junkie and not really ever being around until the four in the morning crash, four in the afternoon rebuilding meant that she relied on her mother to provide valuable life lessons, except she had long given up on the squalor of their lifestyle, the kid herself and her husband even earlier. She had no energy to go through again what had she had put up with for so long. She lived mostly as a husk. The kid, though, was resolute, tried to give life back to her mother but she was too far gone by the time the kid started getting sentimental and tried dishing out life lessons at the tender age of 12. Around that time the father started getting desperate, the benefits running dry, started raiding her piggy bank for loose change that she’d earned helping out neighbours and even the gated community about a 15 minute walk east of their hellhole. Typical situation plays out where the husband leaves or dies or gets institutionalised or something, the mother gets better for a while, then reverts back to that husk when she realises that she actually did get too far gone and can’t readjust properly back into society. So the kid is properly bored out of her mind after a few years of self-funded motherly therapy and starts playing around with her father’s old PC left to the dust and the moths way, way back. So one thing leads to another and soon she’s building her own PCs, fiddling with sockets, programming her own software to generate melodies and so on, she enrols on this computer science course because it was all the rage back in the early millenium, gets tired of the university bureaucracy and drops out. Enter this illusive figure, Doc, who takes her under his wing. Doc has her on D.T. these days. Resolute minds are just as prone to corruption, corrupted their resolute minds will be at last.

        Then Sarge reaches the last files at the end of his explorer folder. There’s Doc and another. Doc has a single page. All that is known is that he operates under two aliases or, perhaps more prudently, two personalities. Doc by night, unknown in the vast expanse of the city by day. There are no medical records to suggest that anyone with a name resembling Doc has schizophrenia, although not exactly conclusive, that might open the door to MPD. There’s a house builder out in Reading by the name of Alexei DcMartin which sounds wrong on a few levels. The police investigated for a while but found no traces of the guy anywhere. Still, it is rather believed that, likely on the part of a lack of creative outlets in the police force, that this Doc character started using a second personality to fuel his wild nights: that is, if he is at all medically-speaking disturbed, he developed schizophrenia after organising his personality split, rather than his condition resulting in his splitting of personality, or the soul. There’s even a theory by this one rookie in the force that ascribes more than two personalities to this Doc figure, that he has two for the nightlife, one for the worklife. The Sarge is somewhat worried that, if these criminals aren’t locked up sooner rather than later, then some of the weaker-willed under his wing may even develop schizophrenia themselves.

        The last file is empty aside from one eye-witness account that puts this guy or girl - the witness could not tell - at the scene of the crime at the annual downtown nu-tech convention, started 12 years back. Apparently things had got slightly weird, like not quite weird enough for arrests to be made but weird enough for the Sarge and his team to be put on alert. There was a hostage takeover which quickly dissipated and then some thing was writhing around on the floor squirming with a virtual reality headset strapped to his dome. He was saved and escorted from the floor by what was believed to have been The Mechanic, following a description of said dealer by Sarge, that description not being physical but more motional. His mannerisms are distinct. He carries himself like an 80s icon.

        The Sarge wakes feeling fresh for the first time in months, maybe even years. There’s no explaining it, but he truly believes he can seize the day and conquer the world. He looks at his alarm clock, it reads 07:45. He looks at the date, it reads Wednesday. He knows somehow deep down that today is the day he's going to find those neural criminals, he is finally going to ensure that their way of life is ended. Either that, or he dies trying. Because like, in his mind, if you can't bring something new to the table (in this case arresting a hardened criminal never having before seen the interior of a cell), then what's the point in living at all?

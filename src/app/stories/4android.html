    <p>
        I'd snapped again.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        'Error: restarting' displayed on the screen for approximately two seconds. One application had crashed the entire system. 'See system log for more details' was the only information supplied. Nobody has time for that. It was a text editor that had halted all subsequent actions. A tiny text editor had brought down a sophisticated operating system for seemingly no reason other than it had felt like it.
    </p>

    <p>
        I stared upwards, through all three invisible floors of the library's atrium and beyond its glass ceiling, into the abyss. Global warming seems like a lifetime ago; where had the Sun gone? No notifications either. I sighed for the 438th time and ran fingers through my thick hair.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I eagerly awaited the computer's reboot, the sudden lack of treacle in my limbs startled me. What psychology was at play here? Was I cured? I knew as much about the answer as the computer  did its error.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Morning Bert," came a rather loud voice to the left, just out of my periphery.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Christ, I don't suppose you know what this building is do you?" I asked.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "What are you doing here and what on Earth is <i>that</i>?" the man replied, nodding in the direction of the library's old-style computer. He wore red-rimmed spectacles and arranged his parting down the middle. His hair was long only at the crown and its strawberry blonde colour did little to appeal to the green jumper he accompanied it with, but I would never tell him that.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I explained that because nobody uses contraptions like <i>this</i> any longer, the library had essentially relinquished its posession of <i>them</i> to me. Recent tech lives upstairs, in pods a far cry from the spaciousness I found myself in the company of.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "This atrium might be the quietest place in the city", I added. "Besides, there's more of a chance nobody's logging my keystrokes here."
    </p>    
    
    <p>
        He laughed, more out of pity than anything else, before pressing for an actual reason for my being here.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Finishing up a job application", I replied, truthfully. "Being bored is tiring work."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "But number 5483, you can't get bored! It's not in your list of traits," he responded, raising his eyebrows. His words were muffled under the cup of his hand, as if trying not to raise suspicion.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "I'll have you know, number 78004, that I wasn't programmed to come to libraries either! Nor was I supposed to harbour suspicions about Central Government operations!"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We laughed, inciting the autodesk to flash us a yellow card. There was nobody else here.
    </p>

    <p>
        "So what's this job then?" he asked, without really heading the warning.
    </p>

    <p>
        I told my friend to hang on. The computer back, I re-synced my work. This was the type of computer you had to sync manually, no chains or anything.
    </p>

    <p>
        "We're still good for lunch, right Shell?" I asked. His parents had unfortunately named their son after the Shell oil spill of '34, as a reminder to all who would ever know him. To them, Shell (the corporation) had been continually getting away with murder (rather literally) for the best part of a century. Shell had publicly revealed in '52 that it had seized all oil production and transportation, marking the final fall of fossil fuels - some thirty or forty years in the making. Shell's parents were not convinced. They'd dug up a local Australian news feed that claimed a woman in her 60s had reported seeing tainted black fish whilst out fishing near the Archipel de la Recherche. One time I asked them why they chose Shell over BP. They told me if you crack a shell, you'll get to the good stuff. I still don't fully understand what they meant by that and, to be honest, I'm not so sure they did either. 'How else do the Sin's feed?' they would ask; their nicknames never able to stick. Shell (the human) and I have pointed them towards countless publications verifying the validity of objective taste measurement methods used in the development of synthetic foods but they never listen. They're too set in their ways.
    </p>

    <p>
        Shell wasn't really listening. He was toying with the computer's ancient motion detection system.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Anyway I'll tell you about the job search over lunch," I said.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Finally up for joining us in the real world, huh?"
    </p>

    <p>
        "The... real world? The real world! I visited once, it was so dull! No, the only real world is up here," I told him, sarcastically tapping my left temple.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Say Bert", Shell started. "Punch me."
    </p>

    <p>
        I stared at him, dubious about whether he was joking or not. The autodesk's pointer was broadly in our path.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Let's take this outside, huh?" I requested. "Oh wait a minute, there's a book I want to take out."
    </p>

    <p>
        Shell aimed a slight look of perversion my way and asked whether I had the century.
    </p>

    <p>
        "I only have an hour," he urged. "Make it quick."
    </p>

    <p>
        I told him to forget about it - I would get it tomorrow. The library had been sold as paper-free for nearly two decades, but I had found a selection of out-of-print books on the top floor which nobody else seemed to know (nor care) about.
    </p>

    <p>
        "No go on, you might as well get it now," he reasoned, so I went to retrieve it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside, the Sun was showing signs of breaking free from the clouds; the few rays penetrating our atmosphere bounced from glass to glass to our eyes. We rued our lack of protection and returned to conversation.
    </p>

    <p>
        "It's an Asimov," I told him of the book. It was in vain, however, as he had no idea who the author was, nor perhaps any author. "And no, I won't," I replied belatedly, in case he had been serious.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Don't you need to scan it or something before you take it out?"
    </p>

    <p>
        "They log your ID when you enter and leave, and track whatever you do in between," I explained. "It's all automatic like everywhere else."
    </p>

    <p>
        "For a service that only gets used by your sorry existence, they sure do pump a load of money into it," Shell said, his condescending tone betraying how impressed he actually was.
    </p>

    <p>
        Again he asked for a punch. I gave him a kiss on the cheek to subdue him; had he not taken his meds today?
    </p>

    <p>
        "You can do better than that! I barely felt it."
    </p>

    <p>
        We passed a French couple in the street. Hands-locked and starry-eyed, they were deep in conversation.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Oupi, c'est ca. C'est ca," Shell mimicked after they were out of earshot. "Why do the French enjoy repeating the most mundane of phrases?"
    </p>

    <p>
        "If you knew their language, wouldn't you?" I said, also telling him that I really couldn't do any better. We walked further down the Tamarisk-lined avenue, neither of us paying much attention to our surroundings.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Wait," Shell demanded suddenly. He gave me a rather more forceful fist than I had originally given him. I rubbed my cheek in reaction.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Now, let's see it with meaning this time" he requested once more.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Why are you doing this?"
    </p>

    <p>
        "You said earlier you were bored. I'm just toying with you is all."
    </p>

    <p>
        I smiled externally.
    </p>

    <p>
        "So are you going to punch me or not?"
    </p>

    <p>
        His line of reasoning was questionable; I delayed answer.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Would you punch me properly if I were a 'Sin'?" He asked quietly at last, miming the inverted commas unnecessarily.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Why?"
    </p>

    <p>
        "Just answer the question."
    </p>

    <p>
        I hadn't really considered the difference.
    </p>

    <p>
        "I suppose maybe I would, I mean they can't feel it right?"
    </p>

    <p>
        "Hey, if they got them to taste, who knows what else they can get them to do?" he joked.
    </p>

    <p>
        Looked around, we realised we'd left the library heading in the wrong direction. Agreeing that we should find a place nearby instead of turning back, I recognised a place across the street I had been to before. It served good seafood there. Seafood was reasonably difficult to come by, at least more so than it had been a couple of years ago when I was at university. The availability of seafood followed the average abundance-complacency-austerity-frugality cycle, I had decided.
    </p>

    <p>
        As we made to cross the street, taking care not to get flattened by a trio of passing cyclists, a deafening crack rang out from the direction of the library. It sounded as if the heavens themselves had parted. Perhaps this was the final nail in the library's coffin; perhaps somebody had finally put it out of its misery.
    </p>

    <p>
        That was not the case.
    </p>

    <p>
        A man stood 50 metres from us in the centre of the road, holding a sleek, black rifle to the air, a picture of hell. People, until now part of the scenery, began screaming, the more composed of them instructing the rest to run. They ran almost in unison, not unlike the way a shoal parts from a predatory shark. We, however, remained as barnacles, the road our vessel. The man pointed towards us and moved in.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Shell?" our demon cried, searchingly.
    </p>

    <p>
        I realised too late I'd made the mistake of looking towards my friend. He had likely done little to hide his identity either, I presently rationalised. The gunman moved over the lifeless body. By now, a pool of rich blood had formed where the impact had occurred, also revealing something of his inside. The gunman looked up at me, his harrowed face conveying much of the situation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our conscious predator took off, swimming against the tide of sirens in the distance. I swade after him, through a pair of alleyways, one after the other. He led me to a small opening enclosed by early 21st century, two storey flats, wherein I managed to corner him as he searched for an exit. Paralysed with fear, the once-demon forgot possession of his rifle and allowed an opening to disarm him. How easy the weapon had turned hands; the swiftness of my action had seemed somewhat natural.
    </p>

    <p>
        I pushed the muzzle of the rifle into the murderer's cheek. His lips distorted, his eyes watered. He cowered rather pathetically under my shadow.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Explain yourself," I cried, pushing the rifle further into his cheek.
    </p>

    <p>
        The man looked European, no different to Shell or I. Perhaps Northern European if I had to guess. I failed to recall the accent on his voice when he called for Shell not five minutes ago. He wore all black but for a dark red, almost burgundy, beanie.
    </p>

    <p>
        "I come from Mezza" he uttered, with a slight French accent. I knew Mezza as an approximation of M.E.S.R., Mother's Earth Sans Robotics. "I thought," he started, his eyes entirely locked to the floor. "I thought he was..."
    </p>

    <p>
        "Well it's pretty fucking clear now that he wasn't, huh?" I demanded, rhetorically and with some ferocity, the weight of which it carried I found surprising.
    </p>

    <p>
        Shoving the rifle further still, I was ready to exact total revenge on him. Yet I couldn't, as if deep down I emphasised with him. But it wasn't that exactly. I took a step back, careful not to let the rifle drop below the curvature of his slouched shoulders. The muzzle had branded a circle on his cheek, but it had not drawn blood. What was happening?. The man straightened up ever so slightly, as sirens wailed overhead.
    </p>

    <p>
        A police officer rounded the corner to the enclosing and demanded I drop the weapon in order to bring the hands cradling said machine to my head. I ignored his request, firing a round into his skull. The way the man fell felt odd; it was different to Shell's slow-motion descent to the seabed - this officer folded immediately in a heap, as if he hadn't mastered the finesse of dying. In that moment I forgot about the terrorist behind me and began edging towards the officer. There was blood, only it was a different hue to Shell's: almost grey, lifeless. I kicked away the other weapon, a sidearm rather more advanced than the rifle I still clung to; while I bent down to take a closer look, a second policeman entered the opening and downed me with a shot to the leg without warning. Rolling over, I was now able to see the Sun out in full force. I allowed myself an ironic, external smile.
    </p>

    <p>
        My presence at the scene grew laboured; for too long I waited, as further police arrived along with two ambulances. My leg was bandaged while the police corroborated eye witness statements; the central chain had been updated. Shell's parents may now get their wish, albeit in the most unpleasant of circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
        Two policemen escorted me at last in their patrol vehicle. The officer in the passenger seat swivelled to face me. I recognised him as my adversary.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Why'd you do it kid?" he asked. He was quite a bit younger than the driver. He could not have been much older than myself, if at all.
    </p>

    <p>
        "I was threatened," I replied, defensively. "He had a gun in my face."
    </p>

    <p>
        "An officer of the law is calmly asking you act rational. He asks you to put the gun down. You blow his brains out instead," the officer recounted. "I don't get it. You hadn't committed any crime yet - you weren't accountable for anything."
    </p>

    <p>
        "I was scared." I admitted. "And I wanted to kill something. Or needed to," I added after some time, unable to decide which. "I didn't think I could."
    </p>

    <p>
        "I still don't follow. It's completely irrational,"
    </p>

    <p>
        His eyes had dropped, as if his enthusiasm for the job had waned ever so slightly.
    </p>

    <p>
        "He was my partner," the disappointed officer murmured at last.
    </p>

    <p>
        "He was synthetic anyway."
    </p>

    <p>
        The officer looked up, puzzled. His driver, quiet until now, eyed me in the mirror. He must be the chief, judging by his uniform. <i>The</i> chief or one of many? I didn't know.
    </p>

    <p>
        "What's that got to do with anything?" chief asked.
    </p>

    <p>
        I confessed I had no idea.
    </p>

    <p>
        The building we arrived at looked like no other station I'd seen. It was entirely nondescript, yet as if by design. Rather, to me at least, it appeared the opposite; on peeling its outer skin I felt the building could have formed a profound part of my life at some stage - a <i>presque vu</i> perhaps. Chief stayed put while the officer escorted me in. I wondered if his blood runs a little on the thick side, too.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of the interior I saw nothing to illicit hope nor fear. I was brought to a whitewash room, expecting to be sat down and interrogated before they threw me away in whatever cell had my name on it. The lighting was poor and I could only make out a single bench in its centre, next to a man happily sat at a desk giving his undivided attention to the wall straight ahead. The officer passed me over to a pair well-padded security guards who forcibly detained me on the rather uncomfortable bench. My muscles failed me in my attempts to resist, as if the treacle had returned. The man in the corner had not drawn his attention away from the wall once during my ordeal. I heard a switch and the room descended into complete darkness.
    </p>

    <p>
        "OK", Diana confirmed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bill afforded himself a glance in her direction as acknowledgement. The two of them left. He then spoke 'up' silently to restate the previous command he had given the system. The wall ahead showed the output:
    </p>

    <p>
        -- Apr 19 2087 C SERIES #86201 CONSOLE LOG (VERBOSE) --
    </p>

    <p>
        Apr 19 11:46:02 BST root:'Error: restarting' displayed on the screen for approximately two seconds.<br>
        Apr 19 11:46:02 BST root:One application had crashed the entire system.<br>
        Apr 19 11:46:02 BST root:'See system log for more details' was the only information supplied.<br>
        Apr 19 11:46:34 BST bertie:Nobody has time for that.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        He read through the log. Halfway through his second read-through he received a hall. The speaker announced that early diagnostics showed the victim to be of the E Series. Bill was impressed. He made a mental note to send 86201 to the armoury before signalling for Diana once more.
    </p>

    <p>
        Examining 86201, Bill noticed a bulge in its grey jacket's right pocket. He carefully slid a book out along the path of least resistance. Noting its author, he flicked through the worn, yellowed pages, breathing in the scent of days long past as he did so. Bill smiled both in- and externally, lost in the moment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Diana and her associate Regis returned, wheeling in a more portable recliner for their patient. She read the contents of the wall and started to ask whether Bill was sure, before thinking better of it. The armoury was never used for rehabilitation purposes. Bill was standing now, his back to the three of them and the wall. He made a movement towards another wall, slipping something into its waste compartment. The wall had updated once again to show a note below 86201's destination. It suggested the military division train its empathy capabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
        "But Bill, we don't have a military division", she explained.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bill did not stir. His answer appeared on the wall:
    </p>

    <p>
        We do now.
    </p>

    <p>
        Diana gently shut the door and rejoined Regis in silence outside, unsure of herself.
    </p>

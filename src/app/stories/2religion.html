    <p>
        The atmosphere had soured, glass panes already condensed. Wind loosened shutters. The late morning tends to have that effect. Joseph slammed his fists on the worn and unforgiving desk, playfully more so than out of considerable desperation. "There's nothing for it!" he cried, defeated at last. Once again he had failed at that which he had never really started. The day's local newspaper, at his side and one of but a few discernible decorations in an otherwise distressed apartment, was the likely antagonist. Out of the way in a small town far enough away from mass civilisation for a preserved sense of culture to be observed, yet close enough for the seeds of a logging industry to be sowed from the surrounding Scots pine, he lived as modest a life as he could.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Though the front page led with the arrest of a seasoned criminal, it was pages 12 and 13 that were of interest to Joseph. Any number of open articles may have led to his outburst, among them the opening of a new car park taking the place previously occupied by a local bakery, a tenuous link made to a story circulating regional news wherein an astronaut from the nearest neighbouring town had died in hospital after falling whilst re-tiling his roof, the discovery of trace iridium some 12 miles east of the outskirts, the assertion that the national life expectancy had dropped by two years over the last five, 'every garden shed needs these ten items', or it could well have even been because the feline mortality rate was up half a point from last year.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Turning the page he leapt with joy, so sudden his change in facial features as to evoke imagesry of satellite time lapse photography. Joseph hovered for a moment. Within this short frame of time a daddy longlegs emerged from behind a chest of drawers, hovering in front of him, ditsy as if drunk. Returning to his senses he sat back down, darkness restored over his features, quite confused as to what it was that had erupted in him a moment prior. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        He left his desk, now turning his attention to the television. An advert aired showcasing the opportunities provided by apprenticeships before the start of a game show-type programme entitled 'What Would You Do?'. Joseph let his attention wander in no particular direction. There was only plainness in his expression, as if he was waiting to think. The host of the programme was interviewing the second contestant by now: a forty year old professor who had changed fields no less than three times, from humble beginnings in sociology, to pharmacy and now radiology. The situation appeared slightly beneath the professor to Joseph, who promptly lost interest following a question about clouds. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A series of knocks sounded at the door from which a light-footed character was held to be accountable.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Joe, my pal! How are you?" the figure beamed.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In his friend Michael went, past Joseph with zealous appeal. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Come right in why don't you?" Joseph answered rhetorically, "I'm well, Mike, what brings you here so unexpectedly?"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Unexpected? Am I not welcome here?"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "No, I just-" Joseph started.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Michael grinned."Forget it! What's new?"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Joseph stood quizzical. He paused. "Well, not much I suppose," he said after some deliberation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "It's all go at the office, I was glad to get away for a week." Michael roared, moved over to the desk that had originally opened our scene, searching. "Where can a fool like me get a cup of tea?" he asked brashly. "Rooibos or green would be nice but in any case, please serve me as you'd serve yourself."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Looking across the desk, Michael's eyes met a scruffy-looking wad of paper. "I thought you were no writer?" he asked.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Joseph mumbled an unintelligible few words as Michael read the opening page. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "This is good! It reads well!" Michael exclaimed, exhaling a short and stout laugh. "And that's a fine observation about coffee drinkers!"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "It's terrible."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Listen to yourself!"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Yesterday I liked it; today I want to be rid of it," Joseph said, quietly. He stood by his sole window, looking out across the plains rather than the adjacent forest.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "You are peculiar! Publish it!" Michael advised.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "I don't think so."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Then what are you to do?"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Joseph was defeated once more.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "That I do not know. Why do so many doors open to brick walls? There are so many possibilities yet a great deal more contradictions along with an even greater number of impossibilities masking themselves as opportunities. I've looked down too many paths that lead to nowhere, so I prefer to weigh my ]options on this here bench. If only I were immortal!
    </p>"
    
    <p>
        Michael was only half-listening and had his back to Joseph, now browsing a lone bookshelf adjacent to the desk. "Sounds an awful lot like Oblomovitis to me. Wouldn't you rather be a Stoltz? Perhaps a Pechorin? A Michel Poiccard even?" Michael queried.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Yes, but of course! Of course! But at every turn there is different baggage to carry!" 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Joseph served the tea with milk, electing to follow Michael's advice. "And did Michel not die at the end?"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Well yes, but I'm more interested in the journey than the destination."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "What if the destination is just as important to me?" Joseph said. "Anyway, I'm done with the Russians."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "That's all very well and good of course, but I don't see you embarking on any journeys! Why don't you solve some of those contradictions you mention?"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Oh there are too many to solve in one lifetime! I fear that I will never bear the fruits of my labour."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Joseph bowed his head. "Time! Michael, time is my greatest foe!"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "That's awfully selfish, Joseph. You needn't be alone in your journey."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "But what's the point? In solving one contradiction another will invariably be created!"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Michael sensed that there was no winning this battle. "Do you have nothing to prove?" he asked at last.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Well I..." Joseph slumped into his desk chair. The pair had unwittingly circled one another during their conversation, now returning to their original positions. "Perhaps you're right. I hope you realise that there exist people between Oblomov and Stoltz though."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "But they are only hybrids of the two - and of course I'm right!" Michael beamed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "But how will I ever know whether I'm on the right track?" Joseph responded. "Fear of failure will follow me everywhere. It is likely that I will set forth to be an Alexander the Great or a Lord Byron and yet only end up a lowly titular counsellor."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "You will be told. By God perhaps." Michael calmed him, "and anyway, what's wrong with titular counsellors?"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Two large grins filled the room and Joseph jumped up.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "What are you up to today? You must be free, yes? Shall we go to the lakes? It's been a while!"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "I'm afraid I'm just passing through today, but another time certainly." Noting Joseph's dejection he quickly added, "cheer up old boy, I'll be about. The tea was superb, if not my cup of."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        And with that he left. Standing motionless for a while, Joseph finally resolved to carry out his need for groceries. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Afte an hour of deliberation, Joseph set off, by this time the afternoon in full spring. The tight-knit nature of the town made for just a ten minute walk to the store, a facet of life that he had grown up with never fully appreciating. This fellow reminds me of a Grushnitsky, though I am no hero myself; I could envisage him uttering 'je hais les hommes pour ne pas les mépriser, car autrement la vie serait une farce trop dégoûtante' and believingit, though his stance on women I am less sure of. His indecisiveness is matched only by his short-sightedness. His short-sightedness an irony considering his claims of only having eyes for the future. The past is a source of indifference to him, despite the fact that he frequently acknowledges the importance of history in laying out a foundation for the future. It is as if he dismissed the whole field of history on the basis that 'history is written by the victors.' He can write but he chooses not to, for fear of repetition, both in his life and in the life of others. He understands numbers yet has no use for them. Disillusion spread through him rapidly when he saw that men did not live up to the standards instilled in him by his parents, yet in his parents he too notices deep-seated flaws, flaws that ultimately reside in himself as well. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Parekeets nattered in the bushy trees as the initial drops of Autumn rain splayed across Joseph's face. A green woodpecker took flight at the first signs of downpour, leaving in its wake mass murder enquiries in the heart of several ant nests and deep-seated envy in the eyes of many birds of lesser charm. Few took up residence on this long and winding country road which saw little in the way of cars either. Horses were often seen in their place and there was always the opportunity to enter into conversation with their riders. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The flora became denser, a fact that Joseph hardly registered. He continued along the same winding country roads that he had had the pleasure of walking down many times before. That joy was waning considerably, on the outskirts of a town that Joseph felt had no secrets left to hide. The trees, now forming a natural canopy above the road, allowed little light through: resultantly the way forward was prone to darkness, particularly in the later months when limited sunlight would be allowed little breathing room from the passing, often-bursting clouds. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As Joseph sauntered, a certain phenomenom awoke him from his trance. He spotted an abrupt, dull flashing of light to his left, beyond a wall of nettles. The flashing made him stop and, upon closer inspection, Joseph could make out what appeared to be a trail beyond the thicket. Carefully lifting nettles with the grip of his coat sleeve, what lay beyond looked structural. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        An air of predestination washed pleasantly over Joseph's head. Feeling as though there was nothing to lose, he decided to follow the Siren's calls. The wall, inpenetrable on first glance, appeared a test to Joseph; it was only himself that he had to prove. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Covering up as much of his body as he could, Joseph burst through the nettles with only minor stings sustained to the right side of his lower back, a product of his rising jumper. He brushed himself off and took stock of the surroundings, slightly alert. Behind him, the nettles had assumed their original shape, covering the path once more. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The trail ahead was short; though overgrown, it was evidently man-made. It declined, leading to a small enclosing, a hollow of sorts, that steadily inclined to the far end, surrounded by dense shrubbery which hid the buildings it housed from the other side. There were no cars parked outside the homes and there did not appear to be a way out that did not involve sustaining injuries. Perhaps the residents could fly?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        At the foot of the enclosing stood a solemn, but nonetheless striking chapel. Recounting Michael's remark about God, however serious he may have been, Joseph felt the need to enter. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In fact, no sooner than he had pushed the heavy front doors open had he begun to run down the aisle, full of an unbridled sense of optimism that had no roots in his self. As Joseph approached the alter however, a wave of nihilism hit him.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "There can't be a God!" he cried, stopping in his tracks, the Crucifixion directly ahead. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Perhaps not," came a gentle voice from the front of the chapel. "But would life not be so dull without Him?"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Joseph turned to see a young woman. Her hands held down by her waist, she assumed a shy, yet approachable figure. She wore a white, frailed robe over a pair of stone slacks which fluttered gently over her black slippers in the draft of the open chapel door. He sympathised with what she had said, but felt let down regardless. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Would you like to walk with me?" she asked.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Joseph nodded, the thought of groceries long since evaporated. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        They walked around the enclosing. Through a narrow walkway alongside one of the homes there was a gate, leading out to an open field with waist-high grass. It appeared as though this gate was the only way in and out of the enclosing, itself covered by the tall grass. The field followed the incline of the enclosing; at the top there was a short wooden fence that could be stepped over. The next field held lavendar: regretably it was not spring. There was a pinkness beyond the horizon. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The pair had remained silent since their meeting in the chapel, though there was no tension in their footsteps. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As Joseph let his hand run over the top of the crops, he found reason to return to the subject of religion. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "No rational man can believe in God," he said at last.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "No?" the fair-cheeked woman retorted. "What makes you think that?"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Logically-speaking I mean, He can't exist," Joseph replied, turning towards her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "You think yourself a philosopher?"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Joseph was quiet. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "The Enlightenment movement ended", she said resolutely.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "That doesn't make those great men wrong!" 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "They could well be!" 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Would that it be so!" Joseph sighed, "I feel like a yo-yo, strung between past and future."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        They sat down at last, in a small clearing in the field. Joseph sat cross-legged whilst the woman bent her knees, leaning forward with her arms locked over them. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "What are you searching for?" the woman asked after a prolonged pause.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "I want immortality and direction."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        She weighed her words.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Direction may grant you immortality," she said after a few moments. "But immortality will likely grant you directionless."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Meaningless!" Joseph exclaimed. "May! Likely!" he said, mimicking her. He, too, had to pause for a moment. After calming himself, he finally gave an answer. "If I have to choose, then it is direction I want. Yes! Direction is what I wish for!"
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "And how are you to find direction?" she asked, gently.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Oh, I don't know! I don't know!" cried Joseph, defeated. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        They sat silent. Their pauses never appeared awkward, only searching.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Joseph fixed his eyes on the ground, drawing in the soil with an end of a lavendar stem. Ants darted around the structure. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "My name is Martha." the woman said eventually. "I can guide you."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Joseph turned to face Martha. For much of their conversation, they had returned little eye contact. Soon they stood, watching over the distant fields to the west. They started in that direction, the opposite whence they came. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The sky divided itself in two: one grey and one blue half. The setting sun extinguished the blue, rendering a new purple half the source of light. Birds called out in response to the change, unclear it was from their tone what their thoughts were. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The temperatures were due to drop further next week and beyond that, the shortest day of the year loomed. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I left the pair to their own devices. I do not know where they went, nor what their plans were. They did not reveal any such information as I perched out of sight behind them. If I were not to intervene, I have little doubt that I would hear tales of their ventures - great ones, whatever 'great' implies. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I saw them off over the horizon. Opportunity now lay with me. Evening was abundant, the short days my doing. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I turned my attention back to the hollow. It had taken a while but I had tracked them down. I had seen the potential of their soon-to-be newest member. He had not failed to deliver. I am sure, given time, that he will come to appreciate his role in today's events. In a single day, he accomplished more than he had done up to this point in time. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Martha, Martha, Martha. What a pretty host. I crept back along the walkway I had originally followed the pair down, that had led them out of the enclosing. The shadows of the houses kept me hidden from the peaking eye of the now awoken, crescent moon. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Entering via the half-open window at the back of the first house, I made my way through. There lay a follower rocking slowly in his chair, positioned with his back to me. I slit his throat and exited back out the same window. Nice and easy. The others may prove harder. In the second home I could not find its host. The third house posed a greater threat. As I opened the back door, a crunch met my first step. A light was switched on and the host recognised me. I hissed. He ran to the front door and disappeared. Through a window at the front of the house I saw him striding towards the back gate, likey to be on his way to inform Martha of my arrival. There was no activity in the fourth nor the fifth house. I was, however, compensated with the deaths of four more followers, before approaching the final three homes. Though the tenth home was empty, the eleventh was not. As I made my way inside, dim light permeated the living room downstairs. A follower appeared in front of me, out of the shroud of darkness. She threw herself to my feet, proclaiming innocence, dedicating herself to my cause. I grabbed the woman by the hair and threw her across the room. I then slit her throat, in the same manner as I did my five other victims. I paused for a moment to compose myself, before making my way over to the twelth and final home. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Though there was an empty plot within the enclosing for their latest, final follower's home, the chapel was my next and final port of call. I breached it, at once making it mine. I took to the alter, setting it alight in a blaze of flames, flickering wildly. I had no need to trick fire into making an appearance. He welcomed me as an old friend, as I did him. My time was approaching its close here. I made my way back outside and led a merry dance, the great flames of the fire following. I acted as conductor, the fire at my every beck and call. By now the flames had reached great heights and met with the moon. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Soon enough, Martha approached, Joseph in her shadow. Behind me, at the entrance I had originally followed Joseph in through, the disciples I had not been able to find returned, keeping their distance. I knew that they would not be able to harm me. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Martha took a stride forward, aiming to square off with me. I licked my lips. Joseph tried to stand alongside her, but Martha dismissed him. It was our battle. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In the light of the moon, I drew my weapon. In an instant Martha lay motionless. A shot through the heart, its sound a delight to my ears, reverberated around the enclosing. The followers, new and old alike, dropped their heads. Unable to take action, they gazed at their shoes. I let out a roar of laughter. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Time stopped; the followers remained fixated, the fire a sight of agitation still. Martha picked herself up. We shook hands. What follows is that He returned to his slumber, while I slipped out the back. Time resumed. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This was but one battle in a war that will never be resolved. Martha will be resurrected elsewhere, under a different name. I will find Him once more. He may well win the next battle and the next after that, but we will continue to fight to eternity, as our true maker designed. 
    </p>
